    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Responsive Portfolio Website</strong>
        <p>A personal website that displays your bio, skills, education, projects, and contact info. A great way to show
          your frontend skills to employers.
          And I designed and developed a personal portfolio website to present my skills, academic background, and
          project work in a professional format. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site is fully responsive and
          includes sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. It also has a contact form with input
          validation. This project helped me improve my frontend design abilities, focus on responsive layout using
          media queries, and work with smooth animations and interactive elements. It also demonstrates my creativity
          and attention to detail in building user-centric designs.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Data Entry Form with Validation</strong>
        <p>In this project, I created a data entry form with fields like full name, phone number, email, address, and
          dropdown selections. The form includes real-time validation using JavaScript, ensuring the user inputs valid
          and complete information. Submitted data is displayed in a formatted preview table. This project improved my
          understanding of form handling, client-side validation, and creating a user-friendly UI. The layout is fully
          responsive and styled with CSS to ensure accessibility on mobile and desktop screens.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>To-Do List Web App</strong>
        <p>This is a dynamic to-do list application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to add,
          update, mark, and delete tasks. It stores the task list in the browser using localStorage so users can retain
          their data even after refreshing the page. The app uses DOM manipulation and JavaScript event handling to
          provide a real-time interactive experience. Through this project, I learned how to manage data states in the
          frontend, handle user inputs, and improve UI responsiveness. The layout is kept simple and intuitive to ensure
          ease of use.</p>
